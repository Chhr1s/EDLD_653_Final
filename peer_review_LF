General comments:
- What's the format (e.g. tutorial) of the final project?
- I would definitely add in a description of the data for the final product

Functions:
- just a heads up the "colorblindr" package isn't available for my version of R (4.1.0), so you might want to make note of it somewhere
- the `grad_year_plots` function was pretty long to follow- you could probably break it down into smaller chunks (e.g. create the nested dataframe, then add the column with plots)

Final_Project.Rmd:
