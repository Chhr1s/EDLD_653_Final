```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rmdHelpers)
library(glue)
# source('Scripts/functions.R') # this is throwing an error for me. is there a way to use `here::here` to make this work more seamlessly?

library(here)

source(here::here("Scripts/functions.R")) # this works


```

```{r}
d0 <- 
  download_clean_data(
    start_year = 2011,
    end_year = 2020
    ) 
```

```{r}
## example of selected groups
groups <- 
  c('ALL Students', 
    'Economically Disadvantaged', 
    'Black',
    'White',
    'Not Economically Disadvantaged',
    'Students With Disability', 
    'Students Without Disability'#,'Kindergarteners' # add this to trigger warning
  )
```

```{r}
test <- grad_year_plots(
  cleaned_data_frame = d0, 
  groups_of_interest = groups
  ) # i am getting an error here that has to do with the `colorblindr` package. i'm not sure if this has to do with me updating my version of R and needing to update packages, so it could be due to my personal computer, but if not it's something to consider
```

# Still need to do this: 

## 1. Write function to allow specifying which schools (then embed in `grad_year_plots()` function)

```{r}
schools_of_interest <- 
  c(
  'Appling County High School', 
  'Bacon County High School',
  'Apalachee High School'
)
## basically this: filter(instn_name %in% schools_of_interest)
## with a warning embedded
```

## 2. Write a function to save the plots 

```{r}
# create file directory
files <- str_replace_all(tolower(unique(d0$instn_name)[1:100]), " ", "-")
paths <- here::here("Plots", glue("{files}.png"))
```

## 3. Make it interactive

* shiny to choose which plots to download
* `reactable` table to see the data
