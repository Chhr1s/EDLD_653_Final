source('Scripts/functions.R')

# I've never seen the "source" function used before - this is a really interesting way of separating your functions from the code! I'll definitely explore using this in the future.
```

```{r}
d0 <- 
  download_clean_data(
    start_year = 2011,
    end_year = 2020
    ) 

#d0_test <- 
#  download_clean_data(
#    start_year = 2010,
#    end_year = 2020
#    ) 

# Your "download_clean_data" function seems really elegant, and it works for subsets of years between 2011 and 2020. Your warning message of "End year must be greater than or equal to start year" also works. However, there's one area for improvement - I tried to test the function by putting 2010 as a start year, and instead of giving me the warning message of "Invalid year(s). Data available from 2011 to 2020" it gave me an error message: "Error in if ((file != "clipboard") && !file.exists(file)) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". 
```

```{r}
## example of selected groups
groups <- 
  c('ALL Students', 
    'Economically Disadvantaged', 
    'Black',
    'White',
    'Not Economically Disadvantaged',
    'Students With Disability', 
    'Students Without Disability'#,'Kindergarteners' # add this to trigger warning
  )

# Something that comes up in your html file but which I can't find here is your use of the gsub function to allow a user to subset the groups they're interested in. I really liked this idea, and I especially thought the warning you generated is useful because it tells users what options they do have, not just the ones they don't. A clear area of strength in your project is your use of warnings to communicate with users of this code.
# The only thing about the function that I'm not sure about (an area of improvement? perhaps just an area of questioning) is where it fits - I feel like it would be most helpful if preceding or integrated with the creation of the groups vector before you run the grad_year_plots function. 

```

```{r}
test <- grad_year_plots(
  cleaned_data_frame = d0, 
  groups_of_interest = groups
  )

# This plot is really beautiful!! I love the way you automatically included confidence intervals and integrated the make_plot_titles function into the grad_year_plots function. One area of strength I see here is the way you've nested functions within each other. That way it's easier to change the instructions/preferences for one function without altering the code of another.
# Just to check though, in the html it looks like the graph that got printed says {SCHOOL NAME} in place of the school name - I'm assuming that's just because this is in draft, but you may want to double check that it's working. 
```

# Still need to do this: 

## 1. Write function to allow specifying which schools (then embed in `grad_year_plots()` function)

```{r}
schools_of_interest <- 
  c(
  'Appling County High School', 
  'Bacon County High School',
  'Apalachee High School'
)
## basically this: filter(instn_name %in% schools_of_interest)
## with a warning embedded

# An area of strength here is the way you allow users of this code to customize which groups and schools they want to highlight. That kind of accommodation makes this a really accessible tool.
```

## 2. Write a function to save the plots 

```{r}
# create file directory
files <- str_replace_all(tolower(unique(d0$instn_name)[1:100]), " ", "-")
paths <- here::here("Plots", glue("{files}.png"))
```

## 3. Make it interactive

* shiny to choose which plots to download
* `reactable` table to see the data
